# web-scraping-challenge

This project was done for the University of Pennsylvania Data Analytics Bootcamp using html, Bootstrap, CSS, Flask, Jinja, Pymongo Pandas, and Python, working in VScode and Jupyter Lab. Jupyter lab was used to create Python code to scrape data about the planet Mars. This code was exported as an executable file and turned into a function called scrape_mars. An html template using jinja was built to display the mars data. The scrape_mars function was then used in conjunction with Flask to store the data using pymongo and then pass it into the html template. Many issues were encountered during this project and some have yet to be resolved due to their challenging nature.
